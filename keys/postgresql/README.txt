PostgreSQL RPM GPG Keys
-----------------------

This directory contains keys used for signing the PostgreSQL RPMs on RHEL
(and its derivatives) and Fedora.


The keys which have the PGDG prefix are used to sign PostgreSQL 11 and above
RPMs.

Archived versions (v10 and below) use the RPM-GPG-KEY prefix.
